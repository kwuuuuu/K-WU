        Keira Wu is an interior designer based in Naarm/Melbourne. Her practice is grounded in the
        design and delivery of thoughtful interiors that respond quietly and meaningfully to their context.
  
        With a background in interior design from RMIT and having practiced since 2018, Keira works
        closely with clients, consultants and makers to shape considered, enduring spaces. Her approach
        is measured and responsive—shaped by material curiosity, a sensitivity to atmosphere, and a
        care for the everyday.
